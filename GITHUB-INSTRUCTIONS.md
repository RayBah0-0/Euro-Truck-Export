# 🚀 Push to GitHub Instructions

## ✅ Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to **https://github.com/new**
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name:** `euro-truck-export` (or any name you want)
   - **Description:** "B2B Mercedes-Benz truck export website with 5-language support"
   - **Visibility:** Choose **Public** or **Private**
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

## ✅ Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/euro-truck-export.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Or run this in your terminal now:**

```powershell
# Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/euro-truck-export.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
